\section{Introduction}
Machine learning on graphs has, in recent years, seen an explosion in popularity. While there have been significant advances in algorithms for learning from graph data \cite{defferrard_convolutional_2016,kipf_semi-supervised_2017}, the underlying graph topology has, until recent works \cite{topping_understanding_2021,velickovic_geometric_2021}, received much less attention. In the reported research, we investigate the interplay of graph coarsening and the quality of its learned embedding (as studied, for example, by \cite{akyildiz_understanding_2020,makarov_survey_2021}), which in turn entails an interplay between the coarsening and the performance of a downstream task, in our case, node classification.
