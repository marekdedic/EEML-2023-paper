\section{Introduction}
Machine learning on graphs has, in recent years, seen an explosion in popularity. While there have been significant advances in algorithms for learning from graph data \cite{defferrard_convolutional_2016,kipf_semi-supervised_2017}, the underlying graph topology has, until recent works \cite{topping_understanding_2021,velickovic_geometric_2021}, received much less attention. In the reported research, we investigate the interplay of graph coarsening and the quality of its learned embedding (as studied, for example, by \cite{akyildiz_understanding_2020,makarov_survey_2021}), which in turn entails an interplay between the coarsening and the performance of a downstream task, in our case, node classification.

Our work builds on the HARP method \cite{chen_harp_2018} for pretraining methods such as node2vec \cite{grover_node2vec_2016} on coarsened graphs. While HARP itself works with and modifies the graph structure, this is not the main interest of its authors, who focus more on the classification accuracy for the original graph. The main contribution of this paper is an extension of the HARP algorithm in one of its two main parts -- refining of graph embeddings from coarser to finer graphs. We introduce a novel approach to refining the reduced graph in a targeted way, based on the confidence of downstream node classification. This method maximizes performance under limited graph size. We numerically validate the viability of the proposed methods using experiments on public graph datasets.
