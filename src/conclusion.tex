\section{Conclusion}

In this work, an extension of the HARP algorithm was proposed, which generalizes it from a method for pretraining to a general graph reduction framework. A novel approach to prolonging graphs in the HARP setting was presented, yielding an adaptive algorithm that selectively prolongs the graph in a way that maximizes performance of the considered downstream task under limited graph size. All of the proposed methods were experimentally verified, with the headline result being that at about 40\% reduction in node count, the accuracy was still reasonably close to the accuracy on a full graph for most datasets. An extended version of this work is currently under review for a conference publication. In future work, a simpler, direct way of tackling the performance-complexity trade-off problem for graphs may be studied as an alternative to the approach proposed in this work.
