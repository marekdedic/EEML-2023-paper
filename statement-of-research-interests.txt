My main areas of research interest are multi-instance learning (MIL) and graph neural networks, targeted mostly in the application domains of cyber-security and network traffic analysis. Two of my additional topics of interest are gradient-free optimization and contrastive learning.

I am currently doing a PhD with the topic of representation learning on structured data - encompassing both of my main areas of interest. In my previous projects, I have applied MIL to URL classification for malware detection, studied properties of gradient-free optimization in the MIL setting, applied contrastive learning to obtain multi-instance clustering, studied graph neural networks based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test and recently studied the behaviour of graph representation learners under graph coarsening. I am currently working on a project applying MIL in the setting of anomaly detection and starting one aiming to produce explainable graph models through methods of concept learning.

I would like to attend the summer school to broaden my horizons, receive feedback on my work and establish new connections in an international setting. Another major motivation is the fact that summer schools don't seem to be established at least in the Czech Republic, while they are fairly popular with my Western European colleagues.
